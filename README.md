ðŸ“Š Bike Share Analysis â€“ Google Data Analytics Capstone
This project explores usage patterns in a bike-sharing service to uncover insights that can help the company convert casual riders into annual members. It's based on the Capstone project from the Google Data Analytics Certificate and completed using R for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

ðŸš² About the Dataset
The data contains trip records from Janâ€“Dec 2021 for a fictional bike-share company, featuring:

Ride start/end times

Rider type (member vs casual)

Bike type

Ride duration

Station locations (start/end)

ðŸ§° Tools Used
R (dplyr, lubridate, ggplot2)

Kaggle Notebook

CSV files extracted from real-world bike usage data

ðŸ§¹ Key Steps
Data Wrangling:

Merged 12 CSVs (~5M rows) into a single dataframe

Converted date formats, cleaned missing data

Calculated ride durations and removed outliers

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Compared ride patterns by user type

Analyzed usage by day of week and month

Explored popular bike types and ride lengths

Visualizations:

Bar charts: trips by rider type and weekday

Line graphs: monthly trends in ride volume

Boxplots: ride duration comparisons

ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
Casual riders ride more on weekends, while members ride steadily throughout the week

Casual users take longer average trips

Most rides happen in summer months

Converting casual users may require targeted offers around weekends and longer rides

ðŸ’¼ Business Recommendations
Offer discounted weekend passes to convert casual riders

Promote annual memberships during peak usage months

Explore incentives for longer rides or popular stations
